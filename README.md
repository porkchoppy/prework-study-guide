## Description

This project involved creating a prework study guide for the upcoming full stack development bootcamp. The motivation behind this project was to organize notes learned during prework relating to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and to serve as a reminder and refresher of those notes as necessary. This project provided an opportunity to dive right into hands-on work of the above listed topics in order to get a glimpse into the future work to be covered during the bootcamp.
